App Concept

This app will check live weather data and display what activities are best suited for the current weather conditions.


MVP
As a user, I can record an activity and write what the ideal weather conditions are for this activity.
As a user, I can view the activities that I’ve recorded, and their ideal conditions.
As a user, I can see today’s weather in Newcastle.


Future features
Pre-existing activities to pick from (not having to create your own)
Possibility to choose a condition that is NOT a perfect condition for the activity
User can input postcode and see that location’s current weather
User can input a town’s name and see that location’s current weather

Chatbox? 
AI integration?
